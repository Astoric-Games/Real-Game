    "You wander into one of the many hallways making up the vast labyrinth-like interior of the castle. The hallway is dark, and the flicker of firelight falls onto the stone wall, from an ajar door."

    k "Hmmm"
    k "As I was saying, she will have to be hidden away, Sparrow."
    s "And as I stated, the people will question where she has gone."
    k "The people will not need to know what happened to her. She can disappear quietly and soon no one will remember she ever existed."
    s "Fine."

    s "My lady, sit down. You're going to hurt yourself."
    p "What is happening to me?!"
    s "You were foolish to believe this was just some common cold."
    p "Then what is this?"
    s "You didn't determine that yourself. I know you're smart enough."

    s "..."
    "You search Sparrow and find a key on them. You determine they were going to lock you in your tower! You feel betrayed by not only Sparrow but your father. Why would he do this to you, his daughter?"
    "Then you realize"
    "You knew the tales of this disease of legend. You knew how contagious it was said to be. Your father was doing this for the sake of the kingdom."
    "but it didn't have to be this way."
    "You could find the cure! This would all be resolved."
    "The legends all speak of the cave of life. There must be maps in the library. You could find it."

    s "I'm sorry. I wish it didn't have to be this way."
    "Sparrow takes out a large ornamental key and closes the door behind them. The click of the lock leaves you with a deep feeling of dread."

    p "Yes, we. We can do this. We could steal the maps and find the cave."
    p "Then we can save the kingdom from an epidemic before it even occurs."
    s "My lady, you are getting weaker by the day. Who says you won't succumb to your illness before we can find the cave."
    p "I'm willing to take that chance. I need you to come with me to make sure if I don't make it, you will complete my quest."
    "Join me, Sparrow."
    "You hold out your hand and Sparrow takes it."

    "You are in pain, but determined. You and Sparrow sneak into the library and steal the maps. Using the rope you climb the walls of the castle. You are free, no longer contained. You stumble but Sparrow is always there to catch you. "
    "You and Sparrow find yourselves upon a small summit. The moon rises in full as night breaks the glowing colors of sunlight, turning orange, purple, then black. The stars blink brightly, one brighter than the rest."
